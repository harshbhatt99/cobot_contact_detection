# Cobot Collision Detection

An intelligent solution for enhancing safety in human-robot collaborative environments.

## Description

The Cobot Collision Detection project aims to ensure safety in settings where humans and robots collaborate closely. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project detects potential collisions between cobots (collaborative robots) and humans, thereby preventing accidents and ensuring a safer workspace. The system leverages sensor data to  predict and respond to dynamic environments, making it suitable for various industrial and research applications.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Developed and tested on Windows 10.
* Tested with Python 3.10
* Suitable for deployment on cloud platforms like AWS.

### Installing

* Clone the repository using git clone [https://github.com/harshbhatt99/cobot-collision-detection.git](https://github.com/harshbhatt99/cobot_contact_detection.git)
* Navigate to the cloned directory.

### Executing program

* Install required Python libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run the Flask application:
```
python cobot_collision_avoidance_system.py
```
* Run the Flask application:
The application should now be running on 'localhost' on the specified port.
