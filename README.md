# cobot_contact_detection
This project utilizes sensor data and machine learning to assess the risk of potential collisions between a collaborative robot (cobot) and humans in its surroundings. By analyzing inputs such as joint torques and external forces, this program provides detection to enhance safety in collaborative workspaces.
